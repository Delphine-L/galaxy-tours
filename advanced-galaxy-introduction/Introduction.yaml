      intro: "In part 1 we used an overlap definition of 1 bp (default setting). In order to get a more meaningful definition, we now want to use the information of the position of the peak summit and check for overlap of the summits with genes. So we need to generate a new BED file from the original peak file that contains the positions of the peak summits. The start of the summit is the start of the peak (column 2) plus the location within the peak that has the highest hypothetical DNA fragment coverage (column 5) and as the end we simply define start + 1.<br>
We proceed to use the tool <b>'Compute an expression on every row'</b> twice to add two rows to the peak file containing start and end of the summit."

Another to get the full RefSeq table from UCSC and manually convert it to BED format.)"
